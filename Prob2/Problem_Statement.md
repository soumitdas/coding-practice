The manager of OYO has to buy some tablechairs for a couple-pool-hotel. For each of
the four banks of the pool, he wants to have an equal number of tablechairs. There are
three types of tablechairs set in the outlet. It is possible to buy a set of one tablechairs
for R1 rupees, a set of two tablechairs for R2 rupees, and a set of three tablechairs for
R3 rupees. The manager already has M tablechairs. What is the minimum amount he
should pay to buy such a number of tablechairs Ch that (M+Ch) is divisible by four?
There are infinitely many sets of any type in the shop. He can buy packs of different
types in the same purchase.

Input Format
First-line contains an integer T where T is the number of test cases. For every test case:
The first line contains four space-separated integers M, R1, R2 and R3.

Output Format
For every test case print the minimum amount he should pay to buy such number of
tablechairs Ch that (M+Ch) is divisible by four.
Constraints
1<=T<=10
1<=M<=109
1<=R1,R2,R3<=109

Example
Input
3
4 4 4 4
7 1 2 3
5 2 3 6
Output
0
1
5
Sample test case explanation
In the second test case, M=7, so to be divisible by 4, he either requires 1,5,9.... chairs. So
he will buy a set of one tablechair for R1 rupees. Since R1=1, so the output is 1.
